    "Python decorators are a powerful and useful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class. They provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions. Here’s a breakdown of what decorators are and how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a Decorator?\n",
    "A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. This is achieved by defining a wrapper function inside the decorator that executes code before and after calling the original function12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "First-Class Functions: In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed around and used as arguments just like any other object (string, int, float, etc.)2.\n",
    "Inner Functions: You can define functions inside other functions. The inner function can access variables from the enclosing scope1.\n",
    "Higher-Order Functions: A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result2.\n",
    "Basic Syntax:\n",
    "Here’s a simple example of a decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Define the Decorator: my_decorator is defined to take a function func as an argument.\n",
    "Wrapper Function: Inside my_decorator, a wrapper function is defined that adds some behavior before and after calling func.\n",
    "Return the Wrapper: The wrapper function is returned from my_decorator.\n",
    "Apply the Decorator: The @my_decorator syntax is used to apply the decorator to the say_hello function. This is equivalent to say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)12.\n",
    "Practical Use Cases:\n",
    "Logging: Automatically log function calls.\n",
    "Authentication: Check user permissions before executing a function.\n",
    "Timing: Measure the execution time of functions.\n",
    "Caching: Store results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again12.\n",
    "Example with Arguments:\n",
    "Decorators can also handle functions with arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
