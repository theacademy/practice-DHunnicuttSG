For each of the activities below, write and execute a SQL SELECT statement that will produce the correct results. Each activity includes the expected number of records for each query, but you should also be sure that the results include only the named columns.

Keep in mind that there's usually more than one correct way to write a query. If yours is different the query written by a classmate or your instructor, it may still be correct. Run both and compare the results.
