# OOP Python
Below is a simple an example in Python. Anyone coming into the training with a Java background will appreciate!

# Generators
Generators are core components in Python. Below is an example of a generator for generating primes.

```py
def generate_primes(n):
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        is_prime = True
        for prime in primes:
            if num % prime == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
            yield num
        num += 1

# Example usage:
n = 10
prime_generator = generate_primes(n)
print(f"The first {n} prime numbers are:")
for prime in prime_generator:
    print(prime)

import sys

a = range(1000) # generators yield one value into memory at a time
b = [i for i in range(1000)] # a list has all its data in memory

# compare the sizes
print(f"Size of a generator {sys.getsizeof(a)}")
print(f"Size of similar list {sys.getsizeof(b)}")
